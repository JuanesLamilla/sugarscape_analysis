Analysis code for "A Systematic Experimentation of SugarScape â€” Sugar Growback Rate and Metabolism on Inequality"

## Aim (from the final report)

"This study looks into changes in Gini index stemming from changing metabolism maximums and sugar growback rates across the sugarscape constant growback (model 2) and wealth distribution (model 3) models.

If we view the sugarscape model as an abstraction of real world socioeconomic phenomena, this experiment can essentially be understood as a method of understanding inequality (Gini index) as a function of resource usage requirements (metabolism) and resource abundance (sugar growback rate)."
